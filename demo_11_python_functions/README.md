# Designing Functions in Python



## Designing New Functions: A Recipe



In this demo, we will study the process of designing functions. 
We will follow the 5-step process in our textbook *Practical Programming*, 
Chapter 3, called the **Function Design Recipe**. 
It is called a recipe because it guides you to follow a systematic approach to designing your function. 
Every time you write a function, you need to answer the following questions:

* What do you name the function? 
* What are the arguments, and what types of information do they represent?
* What calculations are you doing with that information?
* What does the function return?
* Does it work as expected?

You will address these questions by following the recipe shown next. 

## The Function Design Recipe

The five steps are as follows:

1. **Examples** Type a few example calls and determine what it should return for those values. 
The name of your function should indicate what is being calculated in your examples. 
1. **Description** Write a few sentences to describe what your function does. 
1. **Header** Type some documentation relating to your function. 
It should be clear to the reader what arguments it takes as input and what value is returned and the types of each variable. 
1. **Body** By now, you should be clear about how your function will work. 
Now type the code to perform the calculations. 
1. **Test** Run the examples from step 1 to verify that your function works as expected. 


## Function Design Example


Consider the simple example of the function ```add_two_numbers``` that, well, adds two numbers.

```python
# Define a function without documentation.
>>> def add_two_numbers(first_number, second_number):
...    
...    total = first_number + second_number
...    
...    return total
...
...
```

The function is fine but how does the user know how it works. 
Guessing is only reasonable if the function is simple. 

```python
>>> add_two_numbers(3,4)
7
```

That makes sense and it appears to work. 
If your user wants to know for sure, they can
search for documentation, as you would for any other function.

```python
>>> help(add_two_numbers)
Help on function add_two_numbers in module __main__:

add_two_numbers(first_number, second_number)
```
There's nothing there yet.

You could print the entire function object but that
is not very convenient for long and complex functions.
```python
>>> add_two_numbers
<function __main__.add_two_numbers(first_number, second_number)>
```

Instead, add documentation to the function in a docstring.


```python
>>> def add_two_numbers(first_number, second_number):
...    """ Add two numbers together and return the sum.
...    
...    """
...    
...    total = first_number + second_number
...    
...    return total
...
```



Now test the documentation by calling for help:
```python
>>> help(add_two_numbers)
Help on function add_two_numbers in module __main__:

add_two_numbers(first_number, second_number)
    Add two numbers together and return the sum.
```

Notice the content from the description in the docstring.

We can improve the docstring by including examples,
so now let's cover all of these step by following
the *function design recipe*.



## Function Design Recipe

Now apply the function design recipe to the ```add_two_numbers``` example.

### Examples

Try to think of some examples that will test the limit of your function.
Note that we can run the tests only because we have already defined the
function in the examples above.

```python
>>> add_two_numbers(3,4)
7
>>> add_two_numbers(0,4)
4
>>> add_two_numbers(-3,3)
0

```

Now you know that your function will have a form like this.

```python
>>> def add_two_numbers(first_number, second_number):
...    
...    
...    
...    return total
...
...
```


### Header

Write a header to contain information about the
the types of variables in your function.

```python
>>> def add_two_numbers(first_number: float, second_number: float) -> float:
...    
...    
...    
...    return total
...
...
```

### Description

Add a description of what your function does, in words.
Include the list of your examples.

```python
>>> def add_two_numbers(first_number: float, second_number: float) -> float:
...    """ Add two numbers together and return the sum.
...    >>> add_two_numbers(3,4)
...    7
...    >>> add_two_numbers(0,4)
...    4
...    >>> add_two_numbers(-3,3)
...    0
...    """
...    
...    
...    return total
...
...
```

### Body

In this case, the body is simple but this is often the most work. 

```python
>>> def add_two_numbers(first_number: float, second_number: float) -> float:
...    """ Add two numbers together and return the sum.
...    >>> add_two_numbers(3,4)
...    7
...    >>> add_two_numbers(0,4)
...    4
...    >>> add_two_numbers(-3,3)
...    0
...    """
...    
...    total = first_number + second_number
...    
...    return total
...
...
```

It seems like a lot of work to do to prepare to write one line of code.
With more elaborate functions, having clearly stated the 
examples, header and description, 
you should be clear about what it is you will compute and the planning will pay off. 



### Test

Finally, test your functions to confirm accuracy. 

```python
>>> add_two_numbers(3,4)
7
>>> add_two_numbers(0,4)
4
>>> add_two_numbers(-3,3)
0

```

If all goes well, these examples should all return
the values you expect.
If not, be sure that your examples are correct
or modify your function definition.
Most of the work in coding is correcting your mistakes.


## Tips

You will get better at writing functions as you gain more experience but the following tips can help you improve more quickly. 
* Start off with a simple case. 
  * Save the corner cases for after your base cases work. 
* Start off with a simple approach.
  * You can adjust the code for faster computation once it is working. 
* Type the comments first.
  * Describe to the first user (you!) how the calculations will be performed. 
  * Split the calculation into checkpoints where you can determine the format 
  of intermediate calculations.
  * Type in the code one block at a time. 
  * Assign values to the arguments (but hide them in comments, so as not to interfere) 
  and run blocks of code in the IDE to test one section at a time.
* If you find it is getting too complicated, consider breaking up the calculation 
into separate parts.  
  * Is there a natural checkpoint where you can test with examples? 
* Choose examples that provide good testing cases. 
  * Does your function work with negative values? 
  * Does it work with missing values? 
  * Does it work with the wrong data types? 
  * Are there any knife-edge cases when the procedure will change? 
  * Are there any obvious boundaries?
* After making any significant changes to a partially-working function, 
re-run all of your test cases to make sure they are still correct.
  * Did you break any of the test cases that were working before?
  * Did you fix any that were not working? 
  * Keeping score is good motivation.
  * With regular testing, you can make changes with more confidence. 





## Designing More Functions: Practice with the Recipe

Let's run through the function design recipe with a few examples
to practice the 5 steps:
1. **Examples**: Type example calls and what you expect it to return.
Choose appropriate names for your function and it's arguments. 
1. **Description**: Write a short description to describe what your function does. 
1. **Header**: Type some documentation to describe the arguments and return value. 
1. **Body**: Type the code to perform the calculations. 
1. **Test**: Run the examples to verify that your function works as expected. 


## Designing Three Birthday-Related Functions



### How Many Days Difference?

The first function we'll design will calculate
the number of days between two days, which are both in the range 
1-365, indicating the day of the year.

#### 1. **Examples**: Create example function calls and return values. 

The first example is simple: the second day comes after the first. 

```python 
>>> days_difference(200, 224)
24
```
The second two consider different cases: 
the first addresses the case when both dates are the same, 
the second allows the dates to be listed in reverse order. 

```python 
>>> days_difference(50, 50)
0
>>> days_difference(100, 99)
-1
```
These examples are more useful than having several examples 
similar to the first case. 


#### 2. **Description**: Describe what your function does. 

State the name of the function, the names of the arguments, 
and the types of variables, for both the arguments
and the return value. 

```python 
>>> def days_difference(day1:int, day2:int) -> int:
```



#### 3. **Header**: Describe the arguments and return value. 

Describe, in words, what the function does, 
so that a user will understand how to use it.
Users also include yourself, and you will benefit from 
this explicit statement as you design the body of the function. 

```python 
...     """Return the number of days between day1 and day2, which are
...     both in the range 1-365 (thus indicating the day of the
...     year).
...     """
```


#### 4. **Body**: Write the code to perform the calculations. 

With everything mapped out, write the code that performs the calculation. 

```python 
>>> def days_difference(day1: int, day2: int) -> int:
...     """Return the number of days between day1 and day2, which are
...     both in the range 1-365 (thus indicating the day of the
...     year).
...
...     >>> days_difference(200, 224)
...     24
...     >>> days_difference(50, 50)
...     0
...     >>> days_difference(100, 99)
...     -1
...     """
...     return day2 - day1
```

#### 5. **Test**: Verify that your function works as expected. 

All programmers make mistakes. 
The good ones find mistakes and correct them. 
Run your examples to verify the calculations. 

```python 
>>> days_difference(200, 224)
24
>>> days_difference(50, 50)
0
>>> days_difference(100, 99)
-1
```
It *looks good to me* (LGTM). 

Now that we have a function with a docstring, 
we can call ```help``` on that function. 


```python 
>>> help(days_difference)
Help on function days_difference in module __main__:

days_difference(day1:int, day2:int) -> int
    Return the number of days between day1 and day2, which are both
    in the range 1-365 (thus indicating the day of the year).

    >>> days_difference(200, 224)
    24
    >>> days_difference(50, 50)
    0
    >>> days_difference(100, 99)
    -1

``` 





### What Weekday Will It be in the Future?

Now let's write a function to map the the day of the week to the numbers
1 to 7, representing Sunday through Saturday, respectively. 
Our aim is to represent a day that is a certain number of days after
a day corresponding to another weekday number. 
We will make it more clear with examples. 

#### 1. **Examples**: Create example function calls and return values. 

If we start on Tuesday (day 3), it should be Wednesday (day 4)
one day later.

```python 
>>> get_weekday(3, 1)
4
``` 
Likewise, Saturday (day 7) comes one day after Friday (day 6). 

```python 
>>> get_weekday(6, 1)
7
``` 

Starting from Saturday (day 7), moving one day forward brings us to Sunday (day 1). 

```python 
>>> get_weekday(7, 1)
1
``` 
Moving zero days forward keeps the number on the same day.
Moving seven days ahead will also result in the same weekday. 

```python 
>>> get_weekday(1, 0)
1
>>> get_weekday(4, 7)
4
``` 
Also, moving any multiple of the seven days, such as ten weeks (70 days), 
should bring us to the same weekday. 
After 72 days, we will move from Saturday to another Saturday, ten weeks later,
and another two days to the next Monday (day 2).

```python 
>>> get_weekday(7, 72)
2
``` 



#### 2. **Description**: Describe what your function does. 

This function takes day numbers as integers and 
returns an integer from 1 to 7. 

```python 
>>> def get_weekday(current_weekday: int, days_ahead: int) -> int:
``` 

#### 3. **Header**: Describe the arguments and return value. 

Now we can put this into words. 

```python 
...     """Return which day of the week it will be days_ahead days
...     from current_weekday.
...
...     current_weekday is the current day of the week and is in
...     the range 1-7, indicating whether today is Sunday (1),
...     Monday (2), ..., Saturday (7).
...
...     days_ahead is the number of days after today.
...     """
``` 


#### 4. **Body**: Write the code to perform the calculations. 

Next, we fill in the body of the function. 
We use the modulud ```%``` to evaluate the day number as 
the remainder after division by 7. 

```python 
>>> def get_weekday(current_weekday: int, days_ahead: int) -> int:
...     """Return which day of the week it will be days_ahead days
...     from current_weekday.
...
...     current_weekday is the current day of the week and is in
...     the range 1-7, indicating whether today is Sunday (1),
...     Monday (2), ..., Saturday (7).
...
...     days_ahead is the number of days after today.
...
...     >>> get_weekday(3, 1)
...     4
...     >>> get_weekday(6, 1)
...     7
...     >>> get_weekday(7, 1)
...     1
...     >>> get_weekday(1, 0)
...     1
...     >>> get_weekday(4, 7)
...     4
...     >>> get_weekday(7, 72)
...     2
...     """
...     return current_weekday + days_ahead % 7
...
``` 

#### 5. **Test**: Verify that your function works as expected. 

Now run the tests. 

```python 
>>> get_weekday(3, 1)
4
>>> get_weekday(6, 1)
7
>>> get_weekday(7, 1)
8
```
Wait a minute! Day 8 is one day out of range. 
This should be a 1, instead, to represent Sunday. 

Let's look back at the function to make some changes. 


```python 
>>> def get_weekday(current_weekday: int, days_ahead: int) -> int:
...     """Return which day of the week it will be days_ahead days
...     from current_weekday.
...
...     current_weekday is the current day of the week and is in
...     the range 1-7, indicating whether today is Sunday (1),
...     Monday (2), ..., Saturday (7).
...
...     days_ahead is the number of days after today.
...
...     >>> get_weekday(3, 1)
...     4
...     >>> get_weekday(6, 1)
...     7
...     >>> get_weekday(7, 1)
...     1
...     >>> get_weekday(1, 0)
...     1
...     >>> get_weekday(4, 7)
...     4
...     >>> get_weekday(7, 72)
...     2
...     """ 
...     return (current_weekday + days_ahead) % 7
``` 

In the first version, we forgot the parentheses ```()```, 
so that the modulus operated on ```days_ahead``` first, 
an then added ```current_weekday```. 
In the corrected version, we perform the addition first
and then convert the final day to a weekday number. 

With that adjustment in place, let's test the function again. 

```python 
>>> get_weekday(3, 1)
4
>>> get_weekday(6, 1)
0
>>> get_weekday(7, 1)
1
```

The third case is fixed, returning a 1 for Sunday, 
but now the second case fails, with a zero instead of 
a weekday from 1 to 7. 

Now we have to diagnose this problem. 
Whenever the sum of ```days_ahead``` and ```current_weekday```
evaluate to a multiple of 7, the calculation 
```(current_weekday + days_ahead) % 7``` returns zero. 

How do we fix this? 
One solution is to subtract one first, then calculate the
remainder, and then add one back. 
This change produces the following function. 


```python 
>>> def get_weekday(current_weekday: int, days_ahead: int) -> int:
...     """Return which day of the week it will be days_ahead days
...     from current_weekday.
...
...     current_weekday is the current day of the week and is in
...     the range 1-7, indicating whether today is Sunday (1),
...     Monday (2), ..., Saturday (7).
...
...     days_ahead is the number of days after today.
...
...     >>> get_weekday(3, 1)
...     4
...     >>> get_weekday(6, 1)
...     7
...     >>> get_weekday(7, 1)
...     1
...     >>> get_weekday(1, 0)
...     1
...     >>> get_weekday(4, 7)
...     4
...     >>> get_weekday(7, 72)
...     2
...     """ 
...     return (current_weekday + days_ahead - 1) % 7 + 1
``` 



With *that* adjustment in place, let's test the function *again*. 

```python 
>>> get_weekday(3, 1)
4
>>> get_weekday(6, 1)
7
>>> get_weekday(7, 1)
1
>>> get_weekday(1, 0)
1
>>> get_weekday(4, 7)
4
>>> get_weekday(7, 72)
2
``` 

Now all of the test cases return the result we expect. 
We are done (unless, of course, 
the function fails in a way that we haven't thought of).
Let's move on for now. 
We will learn more about testing later. 


### What Day Is My Birthday On?

Now that we have those two functions, we can design a third that
uses these functions for intermediate calculations. 
We can figure out what day of the week a birthday falls on, 
given what day of the week it is today, what the current day of the year is, 
and what day of the year the birthday falls on. 


#### 1. **Examples**: Create example function calls and return values. 

If today is Thursday (day 5) and today is the third day of the year, 
what day will it be on the fourth day of the year? 
We expect it to be Friday, day 6. 

```python 
>>> get_birthday_weekday(5, 3, 4)
6
``` 

With the first two arguments the same (Thurday on the third day of the year), 
but the birthday is on the 116th day of the year. 
Let's look at a calendar: day number 116 would be ...

... April 26th, which would also be a Friday (day 6). 

```python 
>>> get_birthday_weekday(5, 3, 116)
6
``` 
What if, instead, we start at day 116, Friday, April 26 
and the birthday we want is the 3rd day of the year? 
That gives us Thursday, day 5, following the first example in reverse. 

```python 
>>> get_birthday_weekday(6, 116, 3)
5

``` 



#### 2. **Description**: Describe what your function does. 

We use the function names in our examples and choose
sensible names for the arguments and specify that 
all of them are integers. 

```python 
>>> def get_birthday_weekday(current_weekday: int, current_day: int,
...                          birthday_day: int) -> int:
``` 



#### 3. **Header**: Describe the arguments and return value. 

Now we can put this into words. 

```python 
...     """Return the day of the week it will be on birthday_day,
...     given that the day of the week is current_weekday and the
...     day of the year is current_day.
...
...     current_weekday is the current day of the week and is in
...     the range 1-7, indicating whether today is Sunday (1),
...     Monday (2), ..., Saturday (7).
...
...     current_day and birthday_day are both in the range 1-365.
...     """
``` 



#### 4. **Body**: Write the code to perform the calculations. 

Let's take stock of the programs we have already:
- Using ```days_difference```, we can figure out how many days there are
between two days. 
- Using ```get_weekday```, we can figure out what day of the week it will be
given the current day of the week and the number of days away. 

This is how many days away the birthday falls:
```python 
days_difference(current_day, birthday_day)
```
Now we can call that ```days_diff``` and plug it into ```get_weekday```:
```python 
get_weekday(current_weekday, days_diff)
```

Putting it all together, we write the following function definition. 

```python 
>>> def get_birthday_weekday(current_weekday: int, current_day: int,
...                          birthday_day: int) -> int:
...     """Return the day of the week it will be on birthday_day,
...     given that the day of the week is current_weekday and the
...     day of the year is current_day.
...
...     current_weekday is the current day of the week and is in
...     the range 1-7, indicating whether today is Sunday (1),
...     Monday (2), ..., Saturday (7).
...
...     current_day and birthday_day are both in the range 1-365.
...
...     >>> get_birthday_weekday(5, 3, 4)
...     6
...     >>> get_birthday_weekday(5, 3, 116)
...     6
...     >>> get_birthday_weekday(6, 116, 3)
...     5
...     """
...     days_diff = days_difference(current_day, birthday_day)
...     return get_weekday(current_weekday, days_diff)
...
``` 



#### 5. **Test**: Verify that your function works as expected. 

Run the function definitions in the Python shell and 
evaluate the examples. 

```python 
>>> get_birthday_weekday(5, 3, 4)
6
>>> get_birthday_weekday(5, 3, 116)
6
>>> get_birthday_weekday(6, 116, 3)
5
``` 
Just as we expected. 


## Writing and Running a Program

Recall the example in which we translated temperature from degrees
Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. 
We can save this program in the file ```temperature.py```. 


```python 
def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit: float) -> float:
    """Return the number of Celsius degrees equivalent to fahrenheit
    degrees.

    >>> convert_to_celsius(75)
    23.88888888888889
    """

    return (fahrenheit - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0


print(convert_to_celsius(80))
print(convert_to_celsius(78.8))
print(convert_to_celsius(10.4))

``` 
When you run it, Python will evaluate the three examples and print out those values. 

```python
26.666666666666668
26.0
-12.0
```

Basically, the Python shell executes all of the commands in the script, 
including function definitions, but also any other calculations that apear. 
In Chapter 6, we will use the birthday example in a similar way,
except that we will exert more control over which statements are evaluated. 



## Omitting a Return Statement: ```None```

Consider this function definition without a return statement. 

```python 
>>> def f(x):
...     x = 2 * x
...
>>> res = f(3)
>>> res
>>>
```

When you execute it and evaluate the result, 
nothing is returned, i.e. it returns ```None```: 

```python
>>> print(res)
None
>>> id(res)
1756120
>>> type(res)
<class 'NoneType'>
```

This value still has a location in memory. 
It has a special type for the empty variable None, called 'NoneType'.


Now add a return statement.
At least that makes the function design more transparent.


```python
>>> def f(x):
...     x = 2 * x
...     return None
...
>>> print(f(3))
None
```




## Dealing with Situations That Your Code Doesn't Handle

Consider this example.

```python 
def pie_percent(n: int) -> int:
    """Assuming there are n people who want to eat a pie, return the
    percentage of the pie that each person gets to eat.

    >>> pie_percent(5)
    20
    >>> pie_percent(2)
    50
    >>> pie_percent(1)
    100
    """

    return int(100 / n)
```

The function works...
```python 
>>> pie_percent(5)
20
```

...but there is nothing to stop someone from entering a negative
number of people.

One way to avoid problems is to add a precondition:



```python
def pie_percent(n: int) -> int:
    """Precondition: n > 0

    Assuming there are n people who want to eat a pie, return the percentage
    of the pie that each person gets to eat.

    >>> pie_percent(5)
    20
    >>> pie_percent(2)
    50
    >>> pie_percent(1)
    100
    """

    return int(100 / n)

``` 
At least when you warn the user,
it is not your fault:
The user should have read the manual (RTM).
 


## Testing Your Code Semiautomatically

The last step after designing the functions in your module is to test them. 
The ```doctest``` module allows us to run the tests that are included 
in the function docstrings. 

Suppose we had a function that converted degrees fahrenheit into celcius.

```python 
def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
    """ (number) -> float

    Return the number of Celsius degrees equivalent to fahrenheit degrees.

    >>> convert_to_celsius(32)
    0
    >>> convert_to_celsius(-40)

    """
                        
    return (fahrenheit - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0

``` 

We can test the function using the examples in the 
description of the function.

```python 
>>> import doctest
>>> doctest.testmod()
TestResults(failed=0, attempted=3)
``` 

This message tells us that three tests were attempted and none failed. 

As an experiment, suppose that we had made an error in our calculation.
Suppose that instead of ```(fahrenheit - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0``` we 
calculate ```fahrenheit - 32.0 * 5.0 / 9.0```. 
That is, we forgot to include the parentheses.

To test this, replace the definition of the ```convert_to_celsius```
function with this:

```python 
def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
    """ (number) -> float

    Return the number of Celsius degrees equivalent to fahrenheit degrees.

    >>> convert_to_celsius(32)
    0
    >>> convert_to_celsius(-40)
    -40
    >>> convert_to_celsius(75)
    23.88888888888889
    """
                        
    return fahrenheit - 32.0 * 5.0 / 9.0

``` 


Then, when we run ```doctest``` on that module.


```python 
>>> import doctest
>>> doctest.testmod()
**********************************************************************
File "__main__", line 6, in __main__.convert_to_celsius
Failed example:
    convert_to_celsius(75)
Expected:
    23.88888888888889
Got:
    57.22222222222222
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   1 in __main__.convert_to_celsius
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
TestResults(failed=1, attempted=3)
``` 

This test failed. That is finds that the calculation returned an error.
When calculating ```convert_to_celsius(75)```, 
the expected answer is ```23.88888888888889``` 
but instead the calculation returns ```57.22222222222222```. 

We will use this testing approach in the script ```my_functions.py```
and in the scripts we will write in Assignment 5.
