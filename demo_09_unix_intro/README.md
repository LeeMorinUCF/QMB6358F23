# Introduction to UNIX 

UNIX is an operating system, just like Windows or OS X are operating systems, but UNIX has a large array of powerful tools for computing. 
It is typically accessed through a terminal window: a text-based interface. 
Without the computational expense of showing images of a desktop and tracking mouse movements, using UNIX at the terminal allows the computer (and the user!) to focus attention on the computing problem at hand. 

A software training organization called [Software Carpentry](https://github.com/swcarpentry) maintains a GitHub repository that offers a comprehensive introduction to UNIX at
[Software Carpentry : Shell Novice](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/tree/main/_episodes). 
You should work through those readings and examples as practice with UNIX, 
in addition to the material in Chapter 2 of the course textbook by [Paarsch and Golyaev](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/gentle-introduction-effective-computing-quantitative-research).
This computing material seems daunting to many novice programmers but it is essential to solve computing problems on an industrial scale. 
These skills are what will separate you from the other job candidates who are restricted to problems that can be solved on a single computer. 



## Shell Command Syntax

Commands submitted to the UNIX terminal window are run on a program known as a *shell*. 
The shell that we will use is called *bash*. 
You submit commands at a command prompt: a line in the window displayed by ```$```.
The first word of a command is the name of a program. 
The last words are often arguments, such as names of files or objects on which the commands operate. 
In between these is typically a set of options, if necessary, in the following format:

```
command -xyz other arguments
```

The options are usually represented as single characters after a hyphen. 
There are entries in a manual for each UNIX command.

```
man name_of_command
```
But Google is a good reference as well. 

There are many tricks and shortcuts that you learn as you go along. 
Some very useful shortcuts are the *wildcards* ```?``` and ```*```.

Consider the list of files printed by ```ls```:
```
ls my_paper.*
ls my_paper_v?.pdf
ls my_paper.t??
```

The ```*``` wildcard specifies that the list includes all files with names that have any sequence of characters in the place of the ```*```, while the remaining characters appear exactly as shown. 
The command ```my_paper.*``` would show ```my_paper.tex```, ```my_paper.log``` and ```my_paper.pdf``` if those were in the directory. 
Compare this with the ```?``` wildcard. 
This specifies that the list of files include those with any single charcter in the place of the ```?```. 
The command ```my_paper_v?.tex``` would show ```my_paper_v1.tex```, ```my_paper_v2.tex``` and ```my_paper_v3.tex```; 
the command ```my_paper.t??``` would show ```my_paper.tex``` and ```my_paper.txt``` but not ```my_paper.pdf```, as long as those files were in the directory. 


## Navigation 

For Windows users, not much file work can be done without File Explorer. 
In UNIX, there are commands that perform any action that can be competed by right-clicking the mouse in File Explorer. 

### Present working directory (Where are you?)

The ```pwd``` command prints the present working directory. 
It is the location in the file system, just like that shown in the address bar at the top of Explorer. 

Using GitBash on a Windows machine, the output is 

```
pwd
/c/Users/le279259/Documents/Teaching/QMB6358_Fall_2020/GitRepos/QMB6358F20
```
which shows that I am working in a folder for this course. 

### List files (What else is here?)

The ```ls``` command *lists* the files in the present working directory. 
Some examples include:

```
ls
ls -a
ls -lh
```

Without any options, ```ls``` simply lists (most of) the files and folders in the present working directory. 
The ```-a``` flag lists *all* files, including ones that may be hidden (i.e. with filenames that begin with a dot). 
The ```-lh``` flag passes two options: the ```l``` calls for the ```l```ong format listing, and the ```h``` specifies that the file sizes be displayed in a ```h```uman-readable format. 
The ```ls -lh``` command prints a clear table of the information related to each file. 


### Changing Directory (Where do you want to go?)

The action of clicking on a folder in Explorer initiates a change of directory. 
In UNIX, the syntax is as follows. 

```
cd folder_1/folder_2/folder_3
```
which will "click" through as many folders as you list in one line. 

You can also state absolute paths; that is, with a path specified relative to your *home directory* with ```~```: 
```
cd ~/folder_1/folder_2/folder_3
```
or from your *root directory* with ```/```:

```
cd /c/Users/le279259/Documents/folder_1/folder_2/folder_3
```
The folder ```/c/``` is the analogue of the ```C:/``` prefix in the Windows path. 
This appears when using a terminal on a Windows machine. 
On UNIX or Linux machines, the root directory is just ```/```, without the ```/c```. 


By default, paths are stated relative to the ```pwd```. 

The ```../``` sequence means "move up one level" in the folder hierarchy from the ```pwd```. 

```
cd ../../folder_a/folder_b/folder_c
```
Moves two folders up then into 3 folders in that branch of the folder tree. 


### Making a new directory (folder)

The UNIX analogue of "New...Folder" is the ```mkdir``` command:

```
mkdir ../../existing_folder/other_folder/new_folder
```

### Removing a new directory (folder)

To reverse this decision, you can delete a folder with ```rmdir```.

```
rmdir ../../existing_folder/folder/folder_you_want_to_remove
```
Note that you cannot remove a directory unless it is emply. 
That is, you specify that you want to remove all the files and folders inside. 

```
rmdir -r ../../existing_folder/folder/folder_you_want_to_remove
```
The ```-r``` option specifies that the removing occurs ```r```ecursively. 

CAUTION: In UNIX, there is no "Undo" command or "Recycle Bin". 
Any file that is removed is forever deleted from the system. 
Make sure that you know what you are doing when you use this command. 




## Files

Similar operations can be perfomed on files. 

### Copying a file

```
cp path/to/file/file.txt path/to/new_file/new_copy_of_file.txt
```
The ```cp``` command works just like "Copy and Paste", without all of the mouse-clicking. 
The copying takes place to and from the files in the paths as specified. 



### Moving a file

Move files with ```mv```:
```
mv path/to/file/file.txt path/to/new_location/new_copy_of_file.txt
```
The ```mv``` command works like "Cut and Paste". 
It can also be used to "Rename" a file, by *moving* it to a file with a new filename:

```
mv path/to/file/old_file_name.txt path/to/file/new_file_name.txt
```



### Removing a file

The ```rm``` command removes (deletes) a file. 

```
rm path/to/file/file_to_remove.txt 
```

CAUTION: In UNIX, again, there is no "Undo" command. You have to know what you are doing. 
(However, if you are in a local copy of a git repository, you can revert to your last commit---see [demo_02_version_control](https://github.com/LeeMorinUCF/QMB6358F23/tree/main/demo_02_version_control).
This is one of the many reasons to use version control software.


### Making a new file

The command ```echo``` will print a sring to screen. 

```
echo "Hello, world!"
```

Combining this with the ```>``` operator directs the output to a file.

```
echo "Hello, world!" > my_new_file.txt
```

If the file does not exist, it creates one. 
If ```my_new_file.txt``` already exists, it overwrites it, unless you use the ```>>``` operator to append to this file:

```
echo "Hello, world!" > file_I_want_to_modify.txt
echo "Hello, again, world!" >> file_I_want_to_modify.txt
```


## Inspecting the contents of a file

One way to observe the contents of a file is through a text editor (see the section on ```vim``` below).
In the terminal, you can print some of the contents to screen with ```head``` and ```tail``` as in the following two examples:

```
head -10 my_file.txt
tail -20 my_other_file.txt
```
These commands print to screen the first 10 lines of the file ```my_file.txt``` and the last 20 lines of ```my_other_file.txt```.

Another useful command is ```cat```,
```
cat my_file.txt
```
which will print the entire contents of a file. 
If the file is large, most of the printout will quickly pass you by. 
You can redirect output to another file with the redirect operators ```>``` or ```>>```. 

## Connecting separate files

### Concatenating files with ```cat```

The power of th ```cat``` command is realized when you want to concatenate two files.
You can con```cat```enate two or more files and the result is a file that is made up of the separate file stacked on top of each other. 

```
echo "The quick brown fox" > file_1.txt
echo " " >> file_1.txt
echo "jumped over the lazy dogs." > file_2.txt
cat file_1.txt file_2.txt > file_3.txt
ls
cat file_3.txt
```
The first four commands create each of the files, 
and the last two commands show the contents of the directory and the combined file. 

### Pasting files with ```paste```

You can also create a file by appending several files side-by-side. 
The ```paste``` command is useful for this. 
Consider the following simple file constructed with the ```echo``` command:

```
echo "a b" > A.dat
echo "c d" >> A.dat
echo "e f" >> A.dat
cat A.dat
```

Now create another file:
```
echo "1 2 3 4" > B.dat
echo "5 6 7 8" >> B.dat
```

Paste them together with the ```paste``` command:
```
paste A.dat B.dat
```
Maybe you want to open this file in a text editor to see what it looks like. 
Output the result to a third file instead:
```
paste A.dat B.dat > C.dat
cat C.dat
```
There are many other tricks you can do with the options on these commands. 
For example, cut out the second and third columns, where the delimiter is a space
```
cut -d ' ' -f 2-3 B.dat > D.dat
cat D.dat
```

Now paste this to the first file to see what difference it made.
```
paste D.dat A.dat
```

### Joining files with ```join```

This procedure is a little more complicated because each row in the datasets are identified with a key. 
In the files ```file1.txt``` and ```file2.txt```, the key is the letters ```a-g``` in the first column of each dataset. 
These files are saved in this directory but I show the contents below to explain the example. 

Contents of ```file1.txt```:
```
a, 1
b, 5
c, 2
f, 7
```

Contents of ```file2.txt```:
```
a, 2
f, 9
g, 3
```


The following command joins the two files together.
```
join file1.txt file2.txt
```
The result is 
```
a, 1 2
f, 7 9
```

Notice that only some of the rows are present. 
In this case, only the rows with matching keys end up in the resulting file.
This is called an ```INNER JOIN``` in the ```SQL``` query language, which we will use later in the course. 

In a more complex (and more realistic) situation, you will have to specify what happens when not all of the information is available. 
The following command is an example: 
```
join -t, -a 1 -a 2 -o0,1.2,2.2 -e ' -' file1.txt file2.txt
```
The result is 
```
a, 1, 2
b, 5, -
c, 2, -
f, 7, 9
g, -, 3
```

There are a lot of options to that command, so I paste an explanation below. 

The options used above tells the utility to expect comma-delimited input (```-t,```) 
and to produce output for all entries in both files 
(```-a 1 -a 2```, otherwise it would only produce output for lines with matching first field). 
We then ask for the join field along with the second column of both files to be outputted (```-o0,1.2,2.2```) and say that any missing field should be replaced by the string ```" -"``` (space-dash, with ```-e ' -'```).

If the input is not sorted, it has to be pre-sorted. 
In shells that understand process substitution with ```<( ... )```, this my be done through

```
join -t, -a 1 -a 2 -o0,1.2,2.2 -e ' -' <( sort file1.txt ) <( sort file2.txt )
```
See below for more information about the sort command. 

To give full credit where it is due, this example is base on a response to a question on the website 
[unix.stackexchange.com](unix.stackexchange.com):

[join-two-files-based-on-a-column](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/395961/join-two-files-based-on-a-column)


Another excellent example can be found here:

[Linux and Unix join command tutorial with examples](https://shapeshed.com/unix-join/)

In this case, the data are not so well behaved. 
The data have to be sorted and the columns are not in a natural order. 


### Sorting files with ```sort```

Before or after these procedures, you may need to sort your dataset. 
Let's make another dataset to show how this works:
```
# Create a file of names
echo "Taylor" > Names.dat
echo "Jones" >> Names.dat
echo "Smith" >> Names.dat
```

Take a look at the file.
```
cat Names.dat
```

Now sort them and take another look
```
sort Names.dat > SortedNames.dat

cat SortedNames.dat
```


## Running scripts

A powerful reason to use the terminal window is to run batch processes. 
You can run scripts for software that can run on your computer without opening the program on the screen. 
This is particulary useful for running programs on another (possibly bigger) computer. 

### Running ```python``` scripts


You can run a ```python``` script at the command line by running python:

```
python3 my_python_script.py
```
and the output will print to screen. 
You can also redirect the output to a file of your choosing with the ```>``` operator:
```
python3 my_python_script.py > my_script_output.out
```

### Running ```R``` scripts

You can run an ```R``` script with either the ```Rscript``` command or ```R CMD BATCH```:

```
Rscript my_script.R > my_script_output.out
```
or
```
R CMD BATCH my_script.R my_script_output.out
```
And you will see the file ```my_script_output.out``` appear in the directory. Notice that the output is more verbose with ```R CMD BATCH```, 
including not only the printed output but the commands that were run.

As mentioned above, the ```>``` operator directs the output of the ```R``` script run by ```Rscript``` to the file called ```my_script_output.out``` (but you can call it anything you want). 
With the ```R CMD BATCH``` command, the default is to print the results to a file in the second argument above. 


Note that the path to your installation of ```R.exe``` and ```Rscript.exe``` 
must be added to your ```$PATH``` environment variable.
This tells UNIX where to look for the file when you try to run ```R``` and ```Rscript``` commands. 
To run these commands, you need to add the ```R``` path to your ```$PATH``` variable.


```
$ export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/R/R-4.0.2/bin"
```


You would have to run this command each tim you open a terminal window, if you want to run ```R``` during that session.
To avoid this repetition, you can add it to a file in your home directory called ```.bashrc```, such as the one available above. 
If you navigate to this location on your local machine, you can copy it to your home directory with the ```cp``` command:

```
cp .bashrc ~/
```

This is just one of many shell scripts that you can run to automate your programs. 


### Running ```shell``` scripts

A shell script is a program containing UNIX commands. 
For example, you can run a series of ```R``` and ```python``` scripts and execute a number of other UNIX commands.
Suppose you collected the following commands into the file ```my_shell_script.sh```.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Navigate to a selected working directory.
cd path/to/my/scripts

# Run a python script.
python3 my_python_script.py > my_py_script_output.out

# Run an R script.
Rscript my_script.R > my_R_script_output.out

# Collect all the files into a compressed file (see below). 
zip my_zip_file.zip *.py *.R *.out my_shell_script.sh


```


To run this script, you would enter

```
$ ./my_shell_script.sh
```
to print the output to screen

or
```
$ ./my_shell_script.sh > my_shell_output.out
```
to redirect any printed output to the text file ```my_shell_output.out```.

The top line ```#!/bin/bash``` communicates the particular shell on which you want to run your program. 
In this course we will use ```bash```. 
The path path to the shell appears after ```#!``` (called sharp-bang, like the sharp symbol from music). 
This path is the result of entering
```
which bash
```

### Conditional Logic

UNIX commands are powerful enough that you can accomplish a lot with only one-line commands. 
However, you can also define variables and use conditional logic and repetition. 
UNIX allows for the common permutations of ```if``` and ```else``` comands that we used in ```R```:

```
if...fi statement
if...else...fi statement
if...elif...else...fi statement
```

For example, you can define a script to run either ```R``` or ```python```, depending on the setting at the top. 

```
RUN_WITH = "R" # Choose to run in R. 
# RUN_WITH = "Python" # Switched off for now.
# You can switch the chosen language by exchanging the commented line. 

if "$RUN_WITH" = "R"
then
    echo "Executing the script in R."
    Rscript my_script.R > my_R_script_output.out
elif "$RUN_WITH" = "Python"
    echo "Executing the script in Python."
    python3 my_python_script.py > my_py_script_output.out
else 
    echo "Error: Language not supported"
fi
```

Note that the ```=``` and ```!=``` options are used only for string comparisons. 
To compare numerically, you must use ```-eq``` and ```-ne```, for "equal" and "not equal", just like ```gt``` and ```lt``` represent "greater than" and "less than"
You can combine these statements with ```-o``` for **OR** and ```-a``` for **AND**, 
as in the sample script ```logical.sh``` above. 

### Repetition

You can also run ```for``` loops in your scripts by following the pattern ```for ... do... done```. 
The scripts ```for_loop.sh``` and ```file_loop.sh``` provide two examples. 
Test them for yourself by running the scripts with ```./for_loop.sh``` and ```./file_loop.sh``` in a terminal window. 
Replace ```./``` with the path to this directory, ```demo_07_unix_intro```, if you are working in another directory, or navigate to that folder first. 

After running ```file_loop.sh```, there will be no output printed to screen but you can see the files created by entering ```ls -lh```. 
Afterward, you can clean up your mess by entering ```rm file_*.txt``` but be sure that there are no other similarly-named files in that directory that you want to keep. 





## Running Scripts in the Background

If a script takes a long time to run, you may want to run it in the background usin the ampersand operator, i.e. the ```&``` operator. 
Place it at the end of a command and you can press ```Enter``` to get the ```$``` prompt back, ready for more commands. 

```
python3 my_python_script.py > my_script_output.out &
$ 
```
You will have to find a way to check when it is finished; using ```cat``` or ```tail``` would display the current contents of the output file ```my_script_output.out```.

Even though this process is running in the background, it will terminate if you close your terminal window. 
Now, if you use the ```nohup``` command, it will make sure that your batch process does ```no```t ```h```ang```up``` when the terminal is closed. 

```
nohup ./my_shell_script.sh > my_shell_output.out &
$ 
```

Then you can come back in an hour (or tomorrow or Monday morning, etc.) to check on the progress of your program. 


## Compressing Files


For example, the command

```
zip MorinPS2.zip *.tex *.pdf ReadMe DoWork.sh
```
creates one ```zip``` file containing 
all files in this directory with the extensions ```.tex``` and ```.pdf```, as well as the files named ```ReadMe``` and the shell script ```DoWork.sh```. 
The reverse operation, recovering the files in a ```zip``` archive, is executed with the ```unzip``` command. 
Similar compression operations are achieved with ```gzip``` or ```tar```. 



## Version Control with GitHub


To *clone* a repo, i.e. download a copy to your local computer, use the ```clone``` option with ```git```:

```
git clone https://github.com/LeeMorinUCF/QMB6358F21.git
```

After you make some changes, you will want to upload them to the repo. 
First verify the changes that have been made, i.e. check the ```status``` of the local copy of your repo. 
Check this from the root folder of your repo (the first folder in your repo).


```
git status
```
Once you choose the files that you want to upload, use the ```add``` option to stage the changes in a particular file. 
Use ```.``` to include all changes.

```
git add .
```
You can also ```add``` particular file names one at a time: 
```
git add my_changed_file.ext
```

Typically, you will ```add``` a number of changes related to a similar coding problem, feature or bug fix. 
Once a collection of files are staged to commit, you should add a message to describe the changes, using the ```m``` option.

```
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```
(The ```m``` option is not really an option because if you skip the message an old-fashioned text editor will pop up insisting that you include a message. 
More about this in my brief description of the text editor called ```vim```.) 

Before we move on to ```vim```, the changes in one or more ```commit```s can be ```push```ed to the online code repository with, for example,

```
git push origin master
```
with ```origin``` representing the particular fork of the repository and ```master``` for the choice of the branch.  
Again, see [demo_03_version_control](https://github.com/LeeMorinUCF/QMB6358F21/tree/main/demo_03_version_control) for more possibilities with ```git```.


## The Default Text Editor: ```vim```

This will typically be a traumatic experience for the new user but the pain will all be worth it should you ever find yourself logging into a computer remotely (which you will), where a graphical text editor is not available. 
A sample of common ```vim```commands is in the following table.

| Command  |  Action                                      |
| -------- |  ------------------------------------------- |
| Esc      |  Escape to start                             |
| i        |  Insert (i.e. typing text)                   |
| Esc :wq  |  Quit and write changes (i.e. save)          |
| Esc :q!  |  Quit (i.e. quit without saving)             |
| v        |  Start selection (for cutting or pasting)    |
| y        |  End selection  (for pasting)                |
| d        |  End selection  (for cutting)                |
| P        |  Paste (before cursor)                       |
| p        |  Paste (after cursor)                        |

There are many other that you can commit to muscle memory over time.
You can find many ```vim``` cheat sheets through your favorite search engine. 


## Remote Computing

### Secure copy files: ```scp```

If you are very averse to using ```vim```, you can always edit your programs locally 
and copy the file to the remote computer. 
Use the ```scp``` command to *secure copy* files *to* another machine. 

```
scp path/to/my/file.txt my_username@other.computer.address:~/path/to/copied/file.txt
```
To copy in the opposite direction (copy a file *from* another computer *to* your local machine), place the remote file and path in the first argument (the *from* argument).

```
scp my_username@other.computer.address:~/path/to/file_I_want_to_copy.txt path/to/my/file.txt 
```

### Secure shell: ```ssh```

To do all of this on a computer located somewhere else (a remote machine), use the ```ssh``` command.

```
ssh my_username@other.computer.address
```

You will be prompted for your login credentials. 
After you enter them, you will see a command prompt in your home directory. 
Now you can do all of this on someone else's computer (provided you have access).


## Running Computing Jobs in Parallel

One of the main benefits of remote computing 
is that you can take of advantage of computing systems 
with much more computing power than your laptop. 
When the remote computer has multiple CPUs, or even multiple cores
on multiple CPUs, you can split up your computing job into
different parts to run each job *in parallel*.
Compare this to running a single script on a single CPU, 
which would be running the script in *series*. 

For some jobs with much repetition, this approach can offer
a substantial savings in time. 
It works best when a computing job is easily separated into small chunks
returning a small output that can be combined into a larger calculation. 
For example, when running a simulation, you can run each realization on a different node. 
It only works when the computing job can be split into independent 
calculations or, at least, calculations with that share a minimal set of information. 
For recursive calculations, you would have to find another approach, 
unless it turns out that you can efficiently split up the calculations
within each iteration within a recursion, 
which still may offer only a minor improvement. 
The benefit, at best, is reducing the calculation by a factor of the number of nodes.
Often, this ideal is not achieved, since there is some overhead in
setting up the nodes for the calculation, passing parameters to
each node, and then returning the output back to the master node. 
Although you can sometimes predict the reduction in computing time 
with pencil and paper, it is often better to discover this empirically by
increasing the scope of your calculation in steps and timing the calculation.

With this motivation out of the way, I will explain how to perform
calculations in parallel using a simple procedure in R. 
There exist many packages and procedures to achieve this but the 
```doParallel``` package, combined with the
```foreach``` package in R is a quick way to get started with parallel computation.

As usual, you will have to install and declare the 
```doParallel``` and 
```foreach``` packages to get started.


```
library(doParallel)
library(foreach)
```
Then you will have to initialize the processors, including selecting the number of cores. 
One approach is to find out how many cores are available:

```
cores <- detectCores()
cl <- makeCluster(cores[1] - 1)
```
The above command leaves only one core idle, which allows for other 
processes to run. 
You might use this on your own laptop, for example. 
If using a shared computing system, you may want to leave room for your 
colleagues to do their work and choose a number of nodes such that others
are still available. 
On ```mseconomics.business.ucf.edu```, there are 48 CPUs, 
so you might select 40 CPUs, leaving 8 for other users and background processes, 
as follows.

```
cl <- makeCluster(40)
```

In any case, register  the cores to initialize the computing job.
```
registerDoParallel(cl)
```

Now the system is ready for the main calculation, which is 
performed by the namesake function in the ```foreach``` package.
In this example, some function ```function_that_does_my_calculation()```
performs the entire calculation in the loop. 

```
my_final_matrix <- foreach(i = 1:100000, .combine = cbind) %dopar% {
   
   my_temp_matrix <- function_that_does_my_calculation()
   

   my_temp_matrix 
}
```

The syntax is similar to a ```for``` loop in R, except that 
it is denoted as a ```foreach``` loop. 
and the expression ```%dopar%``` appears befor the body of the loop
to specify that the loop will be run in parallel, 
using the ```doParallel``` package.  
Along with the argument for the iterators ```i = 1:100000``` 
is an additional argument to specify how to combine the outputs 
of the calculations from each node.
By setting ```.combine = cbind```, the loop 
accumulates the output by taking the value 
from the last statement in the loop (```my_temp_matrix```) 
and appending it to the accumulated output (```my_final_matrix```)
as would be done by 
```
my_final_matrix <- cbind(my_final_matrix, my_temp_matrix)
```
in a serial ```for``` loop. 
Other options for combining the output are available
and are documented in the package documentation. 

When your computing job is completed, be sure to 
stop the cluster to return those resources to make them available to other users. 

```
stopCluster(cl)
```

Note that each CPU will need whatever packages or libraries
are necessary to perform their calculations;
they are separate computers, after all. 
To attach packages on each node, you could include the command 
```library(my_package)``` in the body of the for loop
but the ```foreach``` function allows you to pass 
the names of packages through the ```.packages``` argument:
```
foreach(i = 1:100000, 
        .combine = cbind, 
        .packages = c("dplyr", "tidyr")) %dopar% {
        
        my_calculation()
}
```


As for parameters in memory, however, the ```foreach``` package 
takes care to pass any parameters in the workspace to the nodes. 
In the early days, this communication had to be made explicitly by broadcasting values. 



Putting it all together, you can combine realizations from a simulation.
In this case, the ouput is combined into a matrix by stacking the 
row of estimates on top of each other using the ```.combine = rbind```
argument, which combines output as would be done with the ```rbind()``` function.

```
library(doParallel)
library(foreach)
num_nodes <- 2
cl <- makeCluster(num_nodes)
registerDoParallel(cl)

num_obs <- 1000
num_reps <- 100000

beta_0 <- 0
beta_1 <- 1
beta_2 <- 0.5

my_estimates <- foreach(i = 1:num_reps, .combine = rbind) %dopar% {
   
   my_data <- data.frame(matrix(rnorm(3*num_obs), nrow = num_obs))
   colnames(my_data) <- c('x1', 'x2', 'epsilon')
   
   my_data[, 'y'] <- beta_0 + beta_1*my_data[, 'x1'] + 
                      beta_2*my_data[, 'x2'] + my_data[, 'epsilon']

   lm_model <- lm(data = my_data, formula = y ~ x1 + x2)
   
   lm_estimates <- coef(lm_model)

   lm_estimates 
}

stopCluster(cl)

summary(my_estimates)
```

You can explore this example by choosing different values for the 
number of nodes, the number of replications and the number
of observations in each replication.


For more information on how to use this package, please see the package vignette at 
[Getting Started with ```doParallel``` and ```foreach```](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doParallel/vignettes/gettingstartedParallel.pdf).
As with any other calculation, there exist many more ways to do this but
the pair of the ```doParallel``` and the
```foreach``` package is an easy way to get started.
