## Comments

# In python, there are two ways to write comments: 
# the "#" symbol or triple quotes:



'''
This is a comment.
Be a good citizen and inform your users.
'''
# This is another comment.


# The first is often used for larger blocks of comments, 
# such as a description of your script. 

# Naming conventions:
# You can choose between two main naming conventions
# for the variables and functions in your code.
# this_is_snake_case
# ThisIsCamelCase
# Python is typically written in snake case.


#--------------------------------------------------
## Data types and operators
#--------------------------------------------------

# Operators are very similar to those in other languages.


2+2


# Some notable differences from R is the assignment operator "=" and the exponent symbol (**):


x = 2

x**2


# Python is dynamically typed, meaing that the same variable can be 
# replaced multiple times and take on a different type, as needed. 


x = 3

x = 'string'

print(x)


# As in many other languages, python is case-sensitive:

print(X)


# In the above, x was last set as type string


# The print statement automatically concatenates strings. 

print("this","is","one","string")


# Compare with this:

print("this","is","one","string", sep = "")


#--------------------------------------------------
### Selecting elements of objects
#--------------------------------------------------

# You can select elements of strings as follows


x[2]

x[0]


# Note that the first element has index number zero.
# You can also use negative values.

x[-3]
x[-1]

x[-10]
x[10]


# Note that strings are immutable: they are defined as a fixed value
# and individual elements cannot be altered. 

x[2] = 'x'

# If you want to do such a thing, there is always a work-around:

x = x[0:2] + 'x' + x[3:7]
print(x)

# This was done by taking the two substrings on each side of element two 
# and forming a new string by concatenating them with a one-letter string in the middle. 

# Be careful with the index numbers. You have to keep track of the number of elements. 

x[3:20]




#--------------------------------------------------
### Logical variables and operators
#--------------------------------------------------

# In python, the single = sign is the assignment operator 
# (there is no <- as with R) 
# but the logical test operator for equality is the double equal sign ==, just as with R. 


boolean_ind = x == 5



# The exclamation point is also used to test if two values are not equal. 

other_boolean_ind = x != 5

# Python also has a more versatile set of commands that work like they do in the English language.

yet_another_boolean_ind = not x == 5


#--------------------------------------------------
### Determining the type of a variable
#--------------------------------------------------

# There are some differences between python versions 2 and 3:
# What happens when you run these commands?

z = 3/5

type(x)

type(z)

z

type(3)

type(3.0)

# The type function is used to check the type of a variable. 
# It can be used to veryfy that inputs to a function are the correct type.

type(2) == int


# Python also coerces variables to have a compatible type within calculations.

z2 = 3.0/5

type(z2)



#--------------------------------------------------
### Arrays and lists
#--------------------------------------------------

# Python has notation to keep arrays of variables. 
# A two-dimensional array is like a matrix, except it is really an array of arays. 


a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
# a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 'a']]

type(a)

# For some arrays, used later, the second command throws an error.
# This is because some kinds of arrays only accepts elements of the same type. 
# This also offers a computational advantage. 
# For now, the above are acceptable because a is technically a list, which, unlike strings, are mutable. 

# Once an array is in memory, you can extract subsets of the data by using the 2-dimensional notation. 

print(a)

print(a[0])
print(a[1])
print(a[0][1])
print(a[1][2])

# There are special values in python but it requires special notation compared to R.


a[1][2] = float('nan')


# This uses the float function to convert to a float.
float(2)

int(2.00000)
str(2.0)



#--------------------------------------------------
### Determining whether specific elements in a list.
#--------------------------------------------------

# The in operator is a logical operator for lists. 
# You have to be careful about what exactly you are comparing. 


10 in a

10 in [10, 3, 5]

6 in a
5 in a


[1,2,3] in a

3 in a[0]



# This type of logical value can be used in an if statement. 


#--------------------------------------------------
## Conditional logic
#--------------------------------------------------

# Python has simple syntax that requires less typing.
# This can be confusing at first because there is limited use of brackets and punctuation. 
# The most common (and invisible) type of syntax is whitespace!

# Consider this if statement:


age = 17

if age > 17:
   print("can see a rated R movie")
elif age <= 17 and age > 12:
   print("can see a rated PG-13 movie")
else:
   print("can only see rated PG movies")


# Colons : denote the end of if or elif or else statements. 
# The code in the blocks is denoted by the indeting of the lines of code within the block (not the commands like if or else).

# As before, the else statement is optional. 


age = 1

if age > 17:
    print("can see a rated R movie")
elif age <= 17 and age > 12:
    print("can see a rated PG-13 movie")

# The default is "else, no action", as with R.




#--------------------------------------------------
## Repetition
#--------------------------------------------------


# Python is very flexible with looping over objects.
# As with if statements, use a colon : and indent properly to denote the code block in the for loop. 

words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for w in words:
    print(w, len(w))


# Compare with this:

for w in 'words':
    print(w)
    

# You can call your iterator whatever you want.
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for whatever in words:
    print(whatever, len(whatever))
    for l in whatever:
        print(l)




# While loops work just as they do in other languages. 

i = 5
while i > 0:
  i -= 1 # same as i = i - 1
  print('i = %d' % i)
  print("Inside the loop")


# While loops can be interrupted with a break statement: 

i = 5
while i > 0:
  i -= 1
  print('i = %d' % i)
  if i == 3:
      break
  print("Inside the loop")





#--------------------------------------------------
## Using modules.
#--------------------------------------------------

# Python is very parsimonious in its use of memory. 
# Many basic mathematical functions -besides operators- have to be imported from modules

import math

math.e

math.pi



math.log(math.e)

math.e(math.log(0))


math.e**math.log(7)


must_be_true = math.e**math.log(7) == 7
must_be_true

must_be_true = (math.e**math.log(7) - 7) < 0.0000001
must_be_true

# When you import a module, you can use any object in the module by using the module name and dot before the object (usually a function or a constant).


# You can choose your own abbreviations for modules


import math as m1

m1.e


m1.e == math.e



# Some packages are a mouthful. Choose an appropriate abbreviation. 

import super_long_package_name as s

s.function(whatever)

# There is such a thing as being too concise.

# But there is also such a thing as being too verbose.

import math as super_long_package_name

super_long_package_name.e

# It makes sense to make your abbreviations informative.

import math as x

x.e


# Some modules have standard abbreviations; go with convention.

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

# ... and for a real script (not a demo) declare your modules
# at the top of the script.


#--------------------------------------------------
# Creating functions.
#--------------------------------------------------


# Functions are defined with the def: operator. 
# Consider this first attempt:

# Defining a function.
def FeetToMetres(feet):
centi = 2.54
inches = 12
return feet*inches*centi/100

# Python will complain. In other languages, indenting is a matter of style and readability. 
# In python, whitespace (tabs and spaces) is part of the syntax:
# Notice the red "X" symbol in the marging to indicate an error.

# Try again:
def FeetToMetres(feet):
    centi = 2.54
    inches = 12
    return feet*inches*centi/100


# Python also uses the return statement to break and return. 

def FeetToMetres(feet):
    centi = 2.54
    inches = 12
    return feet*inches*centi/100
    print("Calculation complete")

# Indenting usually indicates when the function block is over but, just like with R, the return statement ends the execution of the function. 

FeetToMetres(9.5)

# Notice that it did not print "Calculation complete" after the calculation was complete. 

# Let's reset the function definition to the original. 

def FeetToMetres2(feet):
    centi = 2.54
    inches = 12
return feet*inches*centi/100


# Once the next line is not indeneted, python knows that the function definition is over; 
# there is no need for braces {}. 


def FeetToMetres(feet):
    centi = 2.54
    inches = 12
    return feet*inches*centi/100
print("x")


# Consider this example. 
# What if I make a mistake in spelling a variable?

def FeetToMetres2(feet):
    centi = 2.54
    inches = 12
    return feet*inches*cen/100



FeetToMetres2(10)

# Can you find the mistake?


# Now consider if I had such a variable in memory. 

cen = 7
FeetToMetres(10)
FeetToMetres2(10)

# Are you surprised?
# What's going on?
# Some bugs are difficult to troubleshoot. 

#--------------------------------------------------
### Example: Odd or Even Number?
#--------------------------------------------------


# Determine whether a number is odd or even.

def OddOrEven(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print('even')
    else:
        print('odd')

# Now test it with some examples.

OddOrEven(7)

OddOrEven(100)

# Try this:
OddOrEven(math.pi)
# What's going on?

math.pi % 2

46 % 5


# Now revise the definition for the extra cases.

def OddOrEven_2(number):
    if type(number) == int:
        r = number % 2
        if r == 0:
            print('even')
        else:
            print('odd')
    else:
        print('Error: Input number not an int')


# Test it to see that the function works.

OddOrEven_2(math.pi)

OddOrEven_2('math.pi')


#--------------------------------------------------
### Example: Compute the Factorial
#--------------------------------------------------

# Write a function that calculates the factorial of an integer n.

# First use a for loop. 

def factorial(n):
    product = 1
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        product = product*i
        
    print( "I'm not finished yet")
    return product
    print("I'm finished")


# Now test it.

print(factorial(5))


print(factorial(math.pi))


# Trim the extra messages now that we know what it is doing.

def factorial_2(n):
    product = 1
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        product = product*i
        i = i + 1
    return product

# Now test this version. Get creative with test cases.

print(factorial_2(3))
print(factorial_2(math.pi))
print(factorial_2(3.99999))

print(factorial_2(1))
print(factorial_2(2))
print(factorial_2(3))
print(factorial_2(4))



# Next use the recursive approach, as in P&G p.167.

def factorial_3(n):
    if n == 1:
        product = 1
    else:
        product = n*factorial_3(n - 1)
    
    return product

# Test this version

print(factorial_3(1))
print(factorial_3(2))
print(factorial_3(3))
print(factorial_3(4))

# Now try to push the envelope.

print(factorial_3(975))
print(factorial_3(980))
print(factorial_3(1000))

# What happened?

#--------------------------------------------------
### Example: Fibonacci sequence.
#--------------------------------------------------

# The Fibonacci sequence is made by taking the sum of the last two elements to make the next element in the sequence. The first two elements are the number one.


# 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

# Let's design a function to calculate it.

def Fibonacci(n):
    fib_list = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i in [0,1]:
            next_fib = 1
        else:
            next_fib = sum(fib_list[(len(fib_list) - 2) : len(fib_list)])

        fib_list.append(next_fib)

    print(fib_list)


# Now let's take a closer look at some of the ingredients.

# First, the range() function generates a range of values.

range(5) + 1



# Now investigate the parts of the recurrence equation, using a simpler example.

fib_list = [1,2,3,4]
fib_list[(len(fib_list) -2) : len(fib_list)]



# Test the function with some examples.

Fibonacci(5)

Fibonacci(20)







# We will use a more formal approach to function design 
# in the next demonstration.
